# QVKbd - Qt Virtual Keyboard

## Virtual Keyboard based on Qt

This is a complete rewrite of VirtualKeyboard for X11 based on Qt.
X11 specific portions of the code were generously taken from the
[kvkbd](https://github.com/KDE/kvkbd) project.

Currently, only English US keyboard layout is supported, keyboard
size is fixed, and a very minimal theming is implemented. The keyboard
can be moved by pressing any empty space and dragging the window.

# This project is no longer maintained. If you're still interested, you should check out [DesQ OSK](https://gitlab.com/DesQ/DesQUtils/OSK.git)(WIP) and [CoreKeyboard](https://gitlab.com/cubocore/coreapps/corekeyboard.git)
