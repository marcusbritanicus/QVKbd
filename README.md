# QVKbd - Qt Virtual Keyboard

## Virtual Keyboard based on Qt

This is a complete rewrite of VirtualKeyboard for X11 based on Qt.
X11 specific portions of the code were generously taken from the
[kvkbd](https://github.com/KDE/kvkbd) project.

Currently, only English US keyboard layout is supported, keyboard
size is fixed, and a very minimal theming is implemented. The keyboard
can be moved by pressing any empty space and dragging the window.
